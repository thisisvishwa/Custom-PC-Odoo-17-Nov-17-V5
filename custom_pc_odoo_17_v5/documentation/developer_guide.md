# Developer Guide

## Module Name: custom_pc_odoo_17_v5

This guide provides an overview of the `custom_pc_odoo_17_v5` module, its structure, and best practices for extending and troubleshooting the module.

### Module Structure

The module follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and is structured as follows:

- `models`: Contains the database models for components, systems, and accessories.
- `controllers`: Contains the main controller for handling requests.
- `views`: Contains the XML files for defining the website structure.
- `static/src/js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the website.
- `static/src/css`: Contains the CSS code for the website.
- `tests`: Contains the unit tests for the models and controllers.
- `data`: Contains the demo data for the module.
- `security`: Contains the access rights for the module.

### Extending the Module

To extend the module, follow these steps:

1. Create a new module with a dependency on `custom_pc_odoo_17_v5`.
2. Define new models or extend existing ones in the `models` directory of the new module.
3. Define new controllers or extend existing ones in the `controllers` directory of the new module.
4. Define new views or extend existing ones in the `views` directory of the new module.
5. Add new static files or extend existing ones in the `static/src/js` and `static/src/css` directories of the new module.
6. Add new tests or extend existing ones in the `tests` directory of the new module.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while working with the module, follow these steps:

1. Check the Odoo server logs for any error messages.
2. Use the Python debugger to step through the code and identify the issue.
3. Check the JavaScript console in your browser for any errors.
4. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
5. If the issue is related to a database operation, check the database schema and ensure that it matches the models in the `models` directory.

### Best Practices

- Follow the Odoo 17 CE standards for coding, UI design, and module integration.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write unit tests for all critical functionality.
- Regularly update and review the technical documentation.
